to see how it works:
head Authors.txt > authors-sample.txt
make sml file based on that

g++ authorETL.cpp -o authorETL
./authorETL Authors-sample0.out


for real work:
./splitByline Authors.txt 100000

create etl file processor then
g++ authorETL.cpp -o authorETL

run the scheduler which runs both etl and gives it output to sparqlify-csv

from 0 to 9
make screens and run them
./Mapperscheduler0.sh

##This Folder contains:
####1.  In Folder:  Evaluation Experiment DATA
Evaluation experiment data, produced with the pipeline and used to evaluate the pipeline in the SCM-KG pipeline related article.  

####2. In Folder: Linking  
Linking configuration of Silk Workbench for linking section of the pipeline.  


####3. In Folder: Mapping
This folder contains mapping rules, ETL code and process schedule used in the pipeline. 

#####3.1 In Folder: process scheduler-MACOS  
Process Manager & ETL Unit code specified for MAC-OS to do evaluation experiment  

Source codes used in the experiment are in folder “code”.  

Compiled code and their usage in action are kept in folder “process” , big produced files are removed from this file for the sake of space limitation in github.  

“wwwExperimentProcess” is same to folder “process” specified for the WWW metadata used for the evaluation of the pipeline.  

“WWWExperiment-mappedData” is the aggregated product of all mapping processes for WWW metadata used for the evaluation of the pipeline.  

#####3.2. In Folder: process scheduler-Linux
Process Manager & ETL Unit code used to create SCM-KG.

Source codes used in the experiment are in folder “code”.    

Compiled code and their usage in action are kept in folder “process” , big produced files are removed from this file for the sake of space limitation in github.
